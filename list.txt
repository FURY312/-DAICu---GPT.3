Human: Explain quantum mechanics briefly.
AI: Quantum mechanics is a branch of physics that deals with the behavior and interactions of particles at the atomic and subatomic level. It is based on the principles of quantum superposition, entanglement, and uncertainty. Essentially, it explains how the universe works at its smallest scales.

Human: It's yours
AI: Thank you! Is there anything else I can help you with?

Human: Hi.
AI: Hi there! How can I help you?
